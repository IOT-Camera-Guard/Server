## Google Cloud IoT Examples
In here there are scripts that allow full bi-directional communication between an IoT device and a server through Google Cloud brokering.


## mqtt_publisher.py
This script uses device credentials to publish events to the MQTT broker residing in Google Cloud.
Using this code a device can 'talk' to the server.

## mqtt_state_subscriber.py
This script uses device credentials to subscribe to the device configuration topic of the MQTT broker residing in Google Cloud.
Using this code a device can receive configuration from the server.

## pubsub_subscriber.py
This script uses service credentials to subscribe to a topic of the Pub/Sub broker residing in Google Cloud.
Using this code a server can receive messages from the device.

## set_device_configuration.py
This script uses service credentials to modify device configuration over REST API of Google Cloud.
Using this code a server can change the configuration of the device.
